# this is h1 
## this is h2 

this is *italic*, this is **bold** Let's try both. **this is bold and _italic_ but now it is not**. \* just to try. Also, this is inline math $a + b = c$ but this is a math block :

$$
\sqrt{a + b = c}
$$

- This is a list 
- This is a second element of a list
- This is a list with __bold__ elements
    - Hello world 
    - How are you ?

There we should try links. Like here, [[Sample.md]]. Or [Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
May i also try to nest parenteses. Like (this is all in one (but this is two) finished )

[this](https://wikipedia.org/hello_world) used to be broken 

```python 
print("hello world")
```

```cpp 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world" << std::endl;
}
```
