In this paragraph, we can see some **bold**, this is also __bold__ text, some ==highlighted== text, ~~Crossed out~~ text. You can also ~~strike~~
text. You can also do some combinations, like **this is bold and _italic_** and ***this is both bold and italic***. You also have to consider escaped, this is a star \*. Sometimes, it is easier to show things throught a list like. 
- One
