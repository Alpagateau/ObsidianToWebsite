# ObsidianToWebsite
A website that reads obsidian flavoured markdown and renders it as html, ready for publication

# Nota Bene 
The math is to be displayed with mathjax, as it is what obsidian uses. 
For the text and the rest, we can do whatever we want baby

Also, let's not implement mermaid rn, neither canvas. Those will take very long to parse and/or to render

# TODO 
- [ ] Ordered lists are not implemented yet
- [ ] Switch to HTTP 2 for more efficient delivery 
- [ ] Sub-lists are not implemented either 
- [ ] Refactor the direction code from main to a utils I think
- [ ] Maybe rewrite the some parts to use regex instead, need to check the fastest
