# ObsidianToWebsite
A webserver i made to publish my Obsidian vault. It specifically reads my vault's folder, but if you want to use it, it should be easy to change.

# Nota Bene 
The math is to be displayed with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), as it is what obsidian uses. 
For the text and the rest, we can do whatever we want baby

Also, let's not implement mermaid rn, neither canvas. Those will take very long to parse and/or to render

# Roadmap
A lot still needs to be done. Some of the features i want to add to the websites are :
1. A graph view (like obsidian)
2. A file tree, showing all the notes
