# ObsidianToWebsite
A website that reads obsidian flavoured markdown and renders it as html, ready for publication

# Nota Bene 
The math is to be displayed with mathjax, as it is what obsidian uses. 
For the text and the rest, we can do whatever we want baby

# TODO 
Ordered lists are not implemented yet
Neither are tables

Also need to create the renderer
