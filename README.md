# ObsidianToWebsite
A website that reads obsidian flavoured markdown and renders it as html, ready for publication

# Nota Bene 
The math is to be displayed with mathjax, as it is what obsidian uses. 
For the text and the rest, we can do whatever we want baby

Also, let's not implement mermaid rn, neither canvas. Those will take very long to parse and/or to render

# TODO 
Ordered lists are not implemented yet
Neither are tables

Also need to create the renderer
